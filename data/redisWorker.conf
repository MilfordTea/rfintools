### Host names must always be written in the capital case
### The following is an example for windows & linux workers saving to a linux machine
### put worker scripts in R/redis-worker-scripts folder

### alternatively, paths could be based on an operating system, e.g.:
### OS_WINDOWS //linuxhost/shared_backup_folder
### OS_LINUX   /path/to/shared_backup_folder

### network path for the windows machine
WINFOO   //linuxhost/shared_backup_folder

### local path for the linux machine
LINBAR   /home/user/shared_backup_folder
